                    <h2>Let us explain a bit more about inizia</h2>
                    <p>At Inizia, we are not here just to sell you an app. We are here to help you ask the right questions, uncover real user needs, and validate your idea before a single line of code is written. We partner with founders and teams to go from concept, to validated product strategy, to a product brought to life through thoughtful design, development, and continuous iteration. Our role is not just to deliver software. It is to make sure you are building something people actually want.</p>
