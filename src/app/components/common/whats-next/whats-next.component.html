                    <h2>The story behind Inizia</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hi, I’m Mica, a software engineer, founder of Inizia, and someone who has always been obsessed with two things: people and problem solving.<br><br>

                        I started Inizia after years in traditional agencies where I kept running into the same issue. Design, engineering and business were treated like separate lanes.<br><br>

                        Inizia exists to fix that. We know great products do not come from silos. They come from collaboration, where creative, technical and strategic minds work together from day one. When those pieces click, guided by real user insight and fast feedback loops, that is when you build something people actually want.<br><br>

                        Over the last six month, I have hand picked a team, that I have personally trained. Today, we are a lean product team working with amazing non-technical founders from all industries, to validate their ideas, craft meaningful experiences and build the right solution, grounded in real problems and real people.<br><br>

                        If that sounds like your kind of approach, let’s chat.
