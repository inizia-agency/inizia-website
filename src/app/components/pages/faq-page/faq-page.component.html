                <!-- WORKING WITH INIZIA -->
                <accordion-group heading="What makes Inizia different from other agencies?" [isOpen]="isFirstOpen">
                    <p>
                        We focus on building the right product—starting with real user problems, validating before coding, and working in short, transparent feedback loops. You’ll never wonder what we’re doing or why—we build alongside you, not just for you.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <accordion-group heading="How do we get started?">
                    <p>
                        First, we sign a mutual NDA so you feel safe sharing openly. Then we jump into a discovery call to understand your idea, your users, and your goals. From there, we outline a plan that fits your stage and budget.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <accordion-group heading="What if I only need help with part of the process?">
                    <p>
                        That works too. Whether you need help validating your idea, improving UX, or maintaining your current app—we can jump in where you need us most.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <accordion-group heading="How will I be involved throughout the project?">
                    <p>
                        Very. We work <em>with</em> you, not just for you. Every client gets access to a private collaboration portal where you can track progress in real-time, see tasks broken down by phase, ask questions, and view all signed documents and shared assets in one place. <br><br>
                        This isn’t a one-way handoff—it’s a shared workspace where strategy, design, and development are transparent and collaborative. You’ll always know what’s happening, what’s coming next, and how your product is evolving. <br><br>
                        We also create a dedicated group chat to keep communication flowing—perfect for quick questions, async feedback, or sharing inspiration along the way. It’s a true partnership.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <accordion-group heading="What role will I play after hiring Inizia?">
                    <p>
                        You’re not just a client—you’re a key part of the team. We consider you the domain expert: you know your industry, your users, and the problem better than anyone. Your insight shapes everything we build. <br><br>
                        That’s why our process is so collaborative. We’ll bring product thinking, design, and technical expertise—but we rely on your deep knowledge to make the right calls. Together, we build smarter.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <accordion-group heading="Who owns the code and the work you create?">
                    <p>
                        You do—100%. Everything we build for you under contract is yours. While we may manage the codebase during the project, we guarantee full handover upon completion or termination. <br><br>
                        We also sign legal agreements that protect your ownership and ensure we will never reuse your code, designs, or ideas for any other purpose or project, especially within your industry. Your IP stays yours—always.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <accordion-group heading="I have an idea, but I’m not technical. Can you still help?">
                    <p>
                        Absolutely. Many of our clients come to us with just a concept or a problem they’ve noticed in their industry. We’ll help you shape it, test assumptions, and turn it into a product that solves real user needs.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <!-- VALIDATION & STRATEGY -->
                <accordion-group heading="Do you help validate ideas before building?">
                    <p>
                        Yes—that’s at the core of what we do. We use interviews, lean prototypes, and experiments to help you avoid building the wrong thing. You’ll get real feedback before investing heavily in development.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <accordion-group heading="What if I already have an MVP or prototype?">
                    <p>
                        Great! We’ll review what you have, talk to users (if you have some), and explore how to improve or scale it. Whether you need a redesign, technical improvements, or feature strategy—we can help.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <!-- DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT -->
                <accordion-group heading="What kind of products do you build?">
                    <p>
                        We specialize in custom web and mobile applications—whether it’s an MVP, internal tool, marketplace, or SaaS product. Every build is tailored to your goals and user needs, not based on templates.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <accordion-group heading="Do you only build apps, or do you design them too?">
                    <p>
                        We do both. Design and development work hand in hand here—our design process is research-led and focused on creating intuitive, scalable interfaces your users will love.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <accordion-group heading="Can I be involved throughout the process?">
                    <p>
                        Definitely. We work collaboratively and value your input. You’ll be part of key decisions and see progress regularly—no black boxes, no long silences.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <!-- TIMELINE & COST -->
                <accordion-group heading="How long does it take to build a product?">
                    <p>
                        It depends on your scope and stage. A lean MVP might take 6–10 weeks, while a larger platform could take 3–6 months. We always start with a phased plan so you can launch early and learn fast.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <accordion-group heading="How much does it cost to work with Inizia?">
                    <p>
                        We price based on complexity and scope, broken into fixed phases like validation, prototyping, and build. Some clients start small with a prototype; others move into larger builds. What matters most is ensuring we’re investing in the right thing. Software is a big investment, and our job is to help you spend every dollar wisely.
                    </p>
                </accordion-group>

                <!-- POST-LAUNCH & SUPPORT -->
                <accordion-group heading="Do you offer support after launch?">
                    <p>
                        Yes—launch is just the beginning. We provide post-launch support, help you track usage, fix bugs, and roll out improvements based on real data. If your product evolves, we’ll evolve with you.
                    </p>
