                    At Inizia, we meet you where you are in your product journey — from idea to launch, and beyond.
                    Each tier is a monthly, fixed-fee partnership. We don’t charge by the hour or scope features line-by-line.
                    Instead, we work in sprints and retainers that align with your current goals — whether that’s validating an idea,
                    building your MVP, stabilising a struggling product, or making ongoing improvements.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-3">
                    <strong>You can start, pause, upgrade, or switch tiers</strong> as your product evolves. Each tier includes clear deliverables,
                    real collaboration, and dedicated time from our team to make progress on what matters most.
                </p>
